# why springBoot

- in the year 200, if you have to create a Java project for the Enterprise then you'll have to use a lot of Java EE features and one of them is EJB
- using EJB, we could have done messaging, lookup for the entities. Entities are heavy and it becomes difficult. So people came up with POJOs. You can achieve the same thing by using POJO and they have included that in Spring Framework

- so Spring is a framework where you can achieve any business purpose
- this framwork can integrate with other frameworks as well like Hibernate, Struts
- using this Spring Framework, we'll be building big applications. We'll be needing some external .jar files, the 2nd thing is the configuration which comes into action and it comes in lot when you're building enterprise applications.
- when we're working on a project, we wanna focus on coding and not configurations, and that's where SpringBoot come into picture and this initiative was taken up by people who came up with SpringFramework
- springFramework is not SpringBoot
- SpringBoot lies in the middle
