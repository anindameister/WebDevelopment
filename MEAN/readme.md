# angular

![Java](https://github.com/anindameister/WebDevelopment/blob/master/snaps/63.PNG)

#### package.json

- dependencies and development only dependencies of the project
- we'll integrate mongoDB from here

#### node modules

- stores all the dependencies which are listed in package.json

```
npm install something
```
- the above would lead to this node module to read the package.json and install them

#### src

- angular app lives here
- app.componenent.html is the initial editing part

#### index.html

- for right now, it is served by ng serve but later it could be made to work with java(my 2nd favourite hots) maybe

```
<app-root></app-root>
```
the above is served by app.component.ts
